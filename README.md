A [Kalmar](https://github.com/aroum/kalmar)/[A. Dux](https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux)-based 34-key split ortho keyboard

Thumb keys are mounted at 90Â° with a [RTLECS MG03254](https://sl.aliexpress.ru/p?key=pW35Gta) magnet pogo-pin unit (9.5mm from center of the through-holes on the main board across both connectors to the edge, connectors are 4mm high, pins are centered, 2.54mm pitch) and held in place with the 3D printable brackets and a D6x3mm cylindrical neodymium magnet on a 4mm M2.5 tapered-head bolt. The magnet couples with a steel 3mm M3 bolt with an unbeveled flathead (D6mm) in the other bracket. The brackets are held on with three M2 bolts, one about 7.5mm, two 3.5mm. Alternatively, you can run a 9mm or longer M2.5 bolt through both brackets if you don't need fold-down packability.

1.5mm-pitch JST connector added for the battery, you can get a male end pre-crimped to wires and easily solder the wires to your battery wires. I added a ground plane and maybe add an optional P6SMBJ5.0CA Zener TVS diode for ESD protection. Better put a non-conductive coating over the JST connector's mount points.

In testing. Intended for tented use.
