A [Kalmar](https://github.com/aroum/kalmar)/[A. Dux](https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux)-based 34-key split ortho keyboard

Thumb keys are mounted at 90Â° with a [RTLECS MG03254](https://sl.aliexpress.ru/p?key=pW35Gta) magnet pogo pin unit and held in place with epoxy putty brackets holding more neodymium magnets. Intended for tented use.

JST connector added as I don't want to deal with soldered fine braided copper wire fraying off in a through-hole ever again.

In testing.
