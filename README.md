A Kalmar/A. Dux-based 34-key split ortho keyboard

Thumb keys are mounted at 90Â° with a RTLECS MG03254 magnet pogo pin unit and held in place with epoxy putty brackets holding more neodymium magnets.

JST connector added as I don't want to deal with soldered fine braided copper wire fraying off in a through-hole ever again.

In testing.
