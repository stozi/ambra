A [Kalmar](https://github.com/aroum/kalmar)/[A. Dux](https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux)-based 34-key split ortho keyboard

Thumb keys are mounted at 90Â° with a [RTLECS MG03254](https://sl.aliexpress.ru/p?key=pW35Gta) magnet pogo-pin unit (9.5mm from center of the through-holes on the main board across both connectors to the edge, connectors are 4mm high, pins are centered, 2.54mm pitch) and held in place with bolted epoxy-putty brackets (e.g., Milliput or so-called 'green stuff') holding more neodymium magnets. Intended for tented use.

2mm-pitch JST connector added as I don't want to deal with soldered fine braided copper wire fraying off in a through-hole ever again. Better put a non-conductive coating over the back of its mount points.

In testing.
